            This affinity diagram describes our initial ideas on what we want our parking lot service to do. It includes initial ideas that we want to expand more on, as well as any technological components and hurdles that we have to acknowledge. There are also some considerations on platforms to access or grow our idea, and solutions to help build the parking lot.

                John Parker Lots is a 19-year old who has to commute at least 30 minutes by car everyday to get to college. For him, "finding a parking spot is incredibly difficult. . . due to numerous other students and people having work or educational opportunities downtown".
