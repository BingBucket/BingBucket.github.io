        <p>
          For parking lots, there should be a way to tell if there are any empty spaces left.

            This affinity diagram describes our initial ideas on what we want our parking lot service to do. It includes initial ideas that we want to expand more on, as well as any technological components and hurdles that we have to acknowledge. There are also some considerations on platforms to access or grow our idea, and solutions to help build the parking lot.

                John Parker Lots is a 19-year old who has to commute at least 30 minutes by car everyday to get to college. For him, "finding a parking spot is incredibly difficult. . . due to numerous other students and people having work or educational opportunities downtown".

        <p>
          In my storyboard, the scenario revolves around a student who had woken up late for their first class. As a result, they use our parking lot app to reserve a parking spot to ensure that by the time they arrive at campus, there will be an available spot for them instead of having to spend even more time looking for one.
